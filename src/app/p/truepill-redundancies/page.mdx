On Wednesday 10th August, Truepill announced that it was shutting down itâ€™s UK operations, save for a small portion to remain on support, just a couple of months after reducing the count by 15%.

Truepill, dubbed as the AWS for pharmacies, performs both the facilitation for and the development of a number of pharmacies, on top of a set of APIs for pharmacies to consume. Itâ€™s worked with the likes of Optum, Numan, Betterman and Mark Cubanâ€™s Costplusdrugs.

I was fortunate enough to help build Costplusdrugs, design a graduate program and work on the UKâ€™s pharamacy APIs, rebuilding the repeat prescription functionality.

Although Iâ€™ve not been affected by the cuts as I was working my notice period at the time, my heart goes out to the entire of the UK team. Iâ€™ve never seen a stronger group of individuals, from management, to engineering, to product.

At the time of the announcement, everybody dug in to support one-another - either on finding new opportunities or just being there as a virtual shoulder. Itâ€™s been a privilege working with the team here in the UK and I truly hope itâ€™s not goodbye forever.
