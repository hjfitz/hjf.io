I love playing with different APIs. Sometimes there are hidden bits of information that you can pull...

In the case of Spotify, we can login, get an access token and pull some information about our favourite tracks. They give us this through a few feeds:

* long-term (all-time).
* short-term (recent 4 weeks).

It's a little different to the yearly wrap-up (and not as cool as [an AI roasting your taste](https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/))

The below login link will log in (via an oauth-implicit flow) and show you those. It will also show your now-playing. If you're already listening to something, clicking a song will play it on your spotify!
