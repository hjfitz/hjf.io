I always find it fascincating to see how people work. I'll eventually even put out a post on my notion dashboard. Moreover, because this page is checked in to git, I'd love to track how *I* do my work over the years.

`/uses` is a faux-standard where div-slingers and keyboard-cowboys alike write about how they drive their output. There's [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) to track more of these - if you also find this stuff interesting.

I'll split this page in to:

* Tooling
* Webapps
* Hardware


## üßô Tooling

In terms of OS, it doesn't matter: as long as it's not Windows. I've not used that thing for years. For personal use, I'm sat on Ubuntu 20.10. For work, I use the latest MacOS.

Everything I need to code lives in a terminal. I use zsh with oh-my-zsh and a few plugins. my $PS1 is `juanghurtado`. My workflow sits me in Tmux: Editor on the left and a small pane for a few stacked terminals.

On Ubuntu, I use Gnome Terminal; It's good enough. On MacOS I use iTerm. I am not a power-user of these two.

I used to be a huge fan of VS Code, until a colleague pulled me back in to Vim - Specifically Neovim. If you don't know what that is, cool. If you do: I'm sorry.

My main plugins are:
* vim-plug: Make it work
* NERDTree: Let me see my files
* fzf: Let me jump to a file - I've got this mapped to `fz<cr>` for speed
* coc: Eslint and highlighting

That's pretty much my stack. I use Firefox for dev (but Chrom* for anything PWA related) and Postman for API calls.

## üåç Webapps

Without any mind-tooling, I'd be horribly organised. I use Notion to drive pretty-much every aspect of my life. I've split this in to Projects, a huge kanboard and a daily tracker. I'll write more about this in the future - I promise.

I also live in the MDN docs, these are incredible. My code lives on [github](https://github.com/hjfitz/). I read a lot of hacker news and css tricks.

## ü§ñ Hardware

Hardware drives the developer - but really, you just need a good, sturdy laptop. I've had this Thinkpad X1 for about 5 years now. It's pre-owned, as old as 7 years and cost me ¬£350. It's got an i7 and 8gb memory. It's plenty fast. Storage doesn't matter to me: I've got photos backed up in the cloud, music on Spotify and code on Github. 

I wouldn't swap this laptop for anything. The keyboard is *smooth* - but after all of the use, I've had to wrap the wrist rest in duct tape. I'm getting the odd shock from it. Not ideal.

For work, I get some nice toys which, knowing my employer, is a shock. I've got an older Macbook Pro (with the touchbar) with an i7 and 16gb memory. It sometimes feels slower than the X1. I've got a Filco Majestouch 2 and Steelseries Sensei - but they're mine. I've also got a couple of Dell U2719D courtesy of work. I've also got my own Samsung S27B970 - the panel on that thing is nuts.

As you can likely tell, the above paragraph describes my desk setup: I'm remote due to 'rona and I'd like to stay that remote thereafter.

There's a lot of words there, but no photos. I'll aim to get some up shortly‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.
