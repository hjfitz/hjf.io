import { DeadInternet } from './main.tsx'


People are talking about [the dead internet theory](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2024/01/16/the-dead-internet-theory-explained/), especially with Generative AI on the rise.


I think that the internet's been dead for a while though. Why wait for bots to fill it, when as a retailer you might sell things and pay for thousands of reviews?


This isn't some pretentious post about the state of the net. I'm far from qualified, and this point only old enough to say "it used to be good".


Instead, I wanted to experiment with things. I've been writing code with AI at work recently. Not as an assistant, but actually making use of it. It turns out that the APIs are pretty good, and Google's Gemini has an exceptionally good pricing tier.


What I'm going to do is build a dead internet. Below, we'll have a mock browser. Go to any site, and AI will generate it. I'll hopefully have figured out how to retain context between queries for a URL, which should lead to some interesting results!

You can get a Gemini API Key for free, on a free-only tier, [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key).
