## Errors Suck on the Web

Errors in TypeScript suck. Native ones, at least. If you‚Äôve ever written a service class or some kind of http adapter layer, you‚Äôve probably seen a pattern like this:

```tsx
class SomeService {
	constructor(private readonly adapterService) {}

	public async runThing<T>(resource: string): Promise<T | null> {
		try {
	    const resp = await this.adapterService.fetchResource<T>(resource);
			return processResponse<T>(resp)
		} catch (err) {
			const e = err as Error
			if (isAxiosError(e)) {
				console.error(`There was an error making the request (status (${e.status})`)
			}
			console.error("There was an error:", e.message)
			return null;
		}
	}
}
```

As your codebase scales (poorly), you might see things like `const e = error as Error`, or other typecasting. The above is a contrived example, but shows a few casts for `e`.

Generally, this can get pretty ugly. Before I throw my thoughts at you, let‚Äôs talk about the line `const e = err as Error`. Why is this necessary? Didn‚Äôt we just catch an error?

## Playing Catch

Although a `new Error()` declaration can throw, it‚Äôs not the only thing that can be thrown. Because JavaScript is *too human;* you can throw anything. 

You can extend `Error` and  throw that. You can throw an unrelated class. You can throw primitives and even `null`. Go ahead, open the console and try it out. The [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) main example shows a `string` being thrown.

You can try to type an error in TypeScript:

```tsx
try {
	somethingThatThrows();
} catch (e: AxiosError) {
//       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ üö®üö®üö®
}
```

As such, the TypeScript compiler will throw a ‚Äú**TS1196**‚Äù error: Caught errors must be annotated as `any` or `unknown`. The compiler won‚Äôt compute what the error caught could be, so we need to make that assertion.

## Discriminated Union Types

I want to touch on a different approach to error handling, but there‚Äôs a bit of admin and background to get over first. Trust me, it‚Äôll make sense and you‚Äôll learn something cool.

Let‚Äôs jump straight in to an example. If you‚Äôre skim-reading this, it‚Äôll help with your parsing. If you‚Äôre reading this normally, you don‚Äôt need contrived examples anymore.

```tsx
interface Success<T> {
	success: true
	data: T
}

interface Failure<T> {
	success: false,
	error: T
}

type Result<T, U> = Success<T> | Failure<U>
```

The above type `result` is a discriminated union type. It‚Äôs a union type, but you can discriminate between the types it could be by the `success` property.

This ideas draws from [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/), but we also draw from Go.

Let‚Äôs look at a larger, worked example

```tsx
interface HTTPError {
	code: number
	reason: string
}

class AdapterService {
	public async fetchResource<T>(path: string): Result<T, HTTPError> {
		try {
			const resp = await axios.get<T>(path)
			return {
				success: true,
				data: resp.data,
			}
		} catch (err) {
			if (axios.isAxiosError(err)) {
				return {
					success: false,
					error: {
						code: err.code,
						reason: err.response.body,
					}
				}
			} 
			return {
				success: false,
				error: {
					code: -1,
					reason: 'An unknown error occurred',
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

class SomeService {
	constructor(private readonly adapterService) {}

	public async runThing<T>(resource: string): Promise<T | null> {
    const result = await this.adapterService.fetchResource<T>(resource);
		if (result.success) {
			return result.data
		}
		if (result.code >= 500) {
			return backoff(this.runThing<T>(resource))
		}
		console.error(`There was an error making the request (status (${e.status})`)
		return null		
	}
}
```

There is, admittedly, some admin at our lowest level or abstraction. It‚Äôs still a mess. With that said, we‚Äôve got a nice refactor on our higher levels. We know with confidence the structure of the error. We stand on the shoulders of giants, and our codebase can scale thusly. 

## Pros and Cons

Knowing the structure of the error isn‚Äôt just the main advantage from this. We don‚Äôt blindly cast errors either. If we‚Äôre using different internal errors, but the structure of the call changes, we‚Äôre not casting blindly throughout the project - just on our lowest abstractions.

We‚Äôre also forced to address the error, like in Go and Rust. We know there‚Äôs an error, we know there‚Äôs an error body. We should do something for it.

```tsx
if (result.success) {
	return result.data
}
// we need to do something with result.error!
```

It makes refactoring in the case of `!result.success` easier. There‚Äôs a lower barrier to entry here.

There are some cons to this approach. You could end up propagating `T` or `null` up through your project‚Äôs layers. Don‚Äôt be lazy here. This scales horribly and I know this from first-hand experience. There‚Äôs still some error casting to handle, too. It‚Äôs a nice pattern, and languages like Rust wouldn‚Äôt have this as the defacto approach if it wasn‚Äôt useful!

## Exceptions are Exceptional

If you‚Äôre interacting with different APIs or services, the calls can fail. There are two types of failure though. Expected failure and *exceptional failure.* 

There‚Äôs a difference: an expected failure is something like validation failures on a request body, or a user might not be authorized to perform an action. These errors tell no lies: you should handle these properly. You *know* that this behaviour is possible in your application.

An exceptional failure is, exceptional. It‚Äôs something that you don‚Äôt expect to happen. These are the things that you want to propagate to the top of your application. This could be something like a missing connection string for your data store, or the user is on an unsupported platform (using Internet Explorer in 2022 is ***exceptional***).

Keep this in mind if you want to give this a go. What do you want to handle? What don‚Äôt you want to handle?
