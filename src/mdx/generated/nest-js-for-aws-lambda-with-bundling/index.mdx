There is nothing on the internet around bundling Nest.js for AWS Lambda. The general consensus is that Nest is a backend framework, and as such you shouldn’t need to bundle it. This makes sense: it’s a heavy framework that has a long cold-start time (think, 2 seconds).

However, for an enterprise that’s constantly hitting a lambda, it’s important that the lambda in question is stable. Nest really excels here, but the codebase is fairly heavy.

## Skeleton With Fastify

Nest is known to drop connections when using Express on a lambda. Fastify is more performant and the AWS Lambda adaptor is officially supported. Below is your adaptor code:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { APIGatewayProxyEvent, Callback, Context, Handler } from "aws-lambda";
import serverlessFastify from "@fastify/aws-lambda";
import { FastifyAdapter, NestFastifyApplication } from "@nestjs/platform-fastify";

import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

let cachedHandler: Handler;

async function initFastify(): Promise<Handler> {
  const app = await NestFactory.create<NestFastifyApplication>(
    AppModule,
    new FastifyAdapter()
  );
  await app.init();

  const fastifyApp = app.getHttpAdapter().getInstance();

  return serverlessFastify(fastifyApp);
}

export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEvent, context: Context, callback: Callback) => {
  cachedHandler = cachedHandler ?? (await initFastify());
  return cachedHandler(event, context, callback);
};
```

Note how we cache the handler for some bonus performance.

## Building with Webpack

Webpack isn’t well documented for Nest, for the reasons discussed above. You can build your code with `nest build --webpack`, but you’ll find that there are some errors:

```typescript
~ $ npx nest build --webpack
ERROR in main

webpack 5.80.0 compiled with 1 error in 1653 ms
```

The Nest docs gloss over this, but there are peer dependencies that aren’t really needed for our case. Nest gives a sample Webpack config:

```typescript
const mode = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'production' : 'dev'
module.exports = (options, webpack) => {
  const lazyImports = [
    "@nestjs/microservices/microservices-module",
    "@nestjs/websockets/socket-module",
  ];

  return {
    ...options,
    mode,
    externals: [],
    module: {
      ...options.module,
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.(t|j)s$/,
          loader: "unlazy-loader",
        },
        ...(options.module?.rules ?? []),
      ],
    },
    plugins: [
      ...options.plugins,
      new webpack.IgnorePlugin({
        checkResource(resource) {
          if (lazyImports.includes(resource)) {
            try {
              require.resolve(resource);
            } catch (err) {
              return true;
            }
          }
          return false;
        },
      }),
    ],
  };
};
```

Note the `lazyImports` array. Nest (and associated libraries) make use of peer dependencies. In these cases, Webpack can’t determine if you need them or not. So it crashes. Be sensible here, and you can either ignore them in an error, or add them to your project with yarn.

Fastify does this. We can add a couple of lazy imports for Fastify peer dependencies:

```typescript
[
  "@fastify/view",
  "@fastify/static",
]
```

However, we’re also looking to export a handler. When bundling, Webpack removes these - because why would we want to export anything if we’re deploying a bundled executable? 

Webpack allows you to name exports, if you’re building a library. Here, we name our `handler` export, which will be picked up by AWS when we deploy our code. This goes in the root or our `webpack.config.json`.

```typescript
{
	output: {
	  ...options.output,
	  library: {
	    name: "handler",
	    type: "umd",
	  },
	},
}
```

## Conclusion

In some informal testing, I’ve noticed the *cold-start* time reduction of up to 800ms, which is pretty profound. 

The bundle size is also significantly smaller then deploying the code + node_modules. This is a reduction of ~600mb to ~4mb. You can take this even further with minification and some tree shaking to about 2mb!

## Appendices

Our final `webpack.config.js`

```typescript
const mode = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'production' : 'dev'
module.exports = (options, webpack) => {
  const lazyImports = [
    "@nestjs/microservices/microservices-module",
    "@nestjs/websockets/socket-module",
	  "@fastify/view",
	  "@fastify/static",
  ];

  return {
    ...options,
    mode,
		output: {
		  ...options.output,
		  library: {
		    name: "handler",
		    type: "umd",
		  },
		},
    externals: [],
    module: {
      ...options.module,
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.(t|j)s$/,
          loader: "unlazy-loader",
        },
        ...(options.module?.rules ?? []),
      ],
    },
    plugins: [
      ...options.plugins,
      new webpack.IgnorePlugin({
        checkResource(resource) {
          if (lazyImports.includes(resource)) {
            try {
              require.resolve(resource);
            } catch (err) {
              return true;
            }
          }
          return false;
        },
      }),
    ],
  };
};
```
