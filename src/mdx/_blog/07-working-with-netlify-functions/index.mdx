Functions as a Service. FaaS. An API without the server. *A little slurp of backend*. Functions are a great way to get a bit of free hosting with minimal development - and effort.

I use Netlify because it just *works*. No faff. No DevOps pipelines. It's great.

Their docs, however, don't cover everything. They don't even tell you the cool bits. 

I'm want to cover two things now:
1. How to write and develop a basic Netlify function, locally.
2. How this integrated with Gatsby (other JavaScript platforms are available).

There's some sick stuff in Netlify - they just don't advertise it well.


## üöÄ Local Development

To start, start a project as you would normally. Pull in the Netlify cli, too.

```bash
yarn init -y 
yarn add --dev netlify-cli
mkdir api/
```

Create a `netlify.toml` file.

I'm **very** happy that this isn't yaml like the other hip providers. I don't like yaml, at all. toml feels far nicer and more organised than yaml, JSON or even JSON5.

We'll use our glorious `netlify.toml` to tell the Netlify CLI where our functions live. For this, I'll put functions in `./api`. Here's our `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  functions = "api/"
  base      = "./"
```

You'll want to create a JS file in `./api` to host your functionality too -

```js
// api/my-function.js
const doSomething = require('./local-file')

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({hello: 'world'}),
  }
}
```

You'll note that our function is in a file called `my-function.js`. This means you will make your request to `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/my-function`.

To run, simple call `npx netlify dev`. When you deploy your code (I like to use the Netlify/Github integration), `netlify.toml` will tell the site where to find your serverless code. 

That's it!

## ‚öõÔ∏è Gatsby Integration

So this is where the docs don't big themselves up enough. This is ***awesome***. You can host both your Gatsby site and your Function with `netlify dev`, on the same port. When they deploy, they'll have the same URL. In code, you can do something like -

```js
const {data} = await axios.get('./netlify/functions/my-function')
```

And it'll translate over both local and prod. Far nicer than setting `process.env.GATSBY_API_BASE`!

How, do you ask?

Simple. Add more to your `netlify.toml`. I'll add my full one. It configures deployment for me, too.

```toml
[build]
	functions = "api/"
	base = "./"
	command = "yarn build"
	publish = "./public"

[dev]
	framework = "#auto"
```

The thing that makes this work is `framework = "#auto"`. Does what it says on the tin. Guesses which framework you use. I'm assuming that this will find things like Next, too!

`base`, `command` and `publish` are all deployment commands. You can infer what they do!

The cool thing here is that your `gatsby develop` will be running on the same port as your function. HMR remains for Gatsby. It's a brilliant experience.
