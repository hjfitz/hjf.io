Node is the most 'human' language. That is, we've built it as a community. If there's something new we want, we [can create a proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposals). If we're impatient, we can hack what we want in to [Babel and transpile](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-stage-0). Types? There's a [thing for that](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). More Pythonic? [Got u fam](https://coffeescript.org/). Any program in 6 chars? [https://badacadabra.github.io/Understanding-JSFuck/](Not a fucking problem).

It's a mad world. It's a mad language and even if you cry *"I'm using ES6!"*, you're not using all of it.

Over my years of ~professional software development~ hacking things together as a security engineer, I've picked up a lot. These are my favourite hacks that I've picked up.

# Easy Arrays/Pythonic Range

If, for whatever reason, you need an array of length `n`, what would you do? Loop to `n` and populate an array?

Everything inherits from `Object` in JS: `Array.from()` can interpret an object as an array-list structure:

```js
const range = num => Array.from({length: num})
```

Every array-list structure will have keys 0 - n, and a `length`. Array.from will take these and attempt to convert the parameter in to a pure array.

# Destructuring and Getting the Array Tail

Pulling the last item from an array is a hassle. We all know the drill:

```js
const arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]
const tail = arr[arr.length - 1]
console.log(`tail: ${tail}`) // tail: 3
```

It's not awful, but if you're dealing with big variable names then it doesn't look great either.

Through the magic of [*destructuring*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), we can pull this more "easily".

I wouldn't advise this for a production codebase, but it's a cool hack no less. I'll explain this one, too.

```js
const arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]
const {length, [length - 1]: tail} = arr
console.log(`tail: ${tail}`) // tail: 3
```

We use a couple of bits of destructuring here -

```js
const {length} = arr
```

Does what we'd expect: pull the key `length` from `arr`.

Next, we use a [computed property key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#computed_property_names) to pull a value from key `[length - 1]` - the tail item from our array.

Cool, right?

Just don't use it in production, *please*.

# Array of Objects to an Object with Arrays

I find myself using this one more than I want to. I like to take a weird sort-of-data-driven approach to programming. First, figure out how the data will flow through the program; fetch it; display it.

Sometimes I work better with data in certain formats - which is why I come to this frequently.

Enter `Array.reduce()`. I prefer to think of in the same way that I was taught about this in Haskell: Instead of reducing the array, you're folding it: you're using a function to fold each item in the array to a final value.

A simple example, summing numbers in an array:

```js
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5].reduce((accumulator, current) => accumulator + current, 0)
```

Where `accumulator` is the value we're "folding" the `current` values in to.

On to the magic: We want to convert:

```js
const myArr = [
  {
    name: "hjf",
    operatingSystem: "gentoo",
  },
  {
    name: "guy",
    operatingSystem: "macos",
  },
  {
    name: "sam",
    operatingSystem: "macos",
  }
]
```

in to:

```js
const myObj = {
  name: ["harry", "guy", "sam"],
  operatingSystem: ["gentoo", "macos", "macos"]
}
```

It's a bit contrived - but we can achieve this with `Array.reduce`:

```js
const myObj = myArr.reduce((acc, cur) => {
  Object.keys(cur).forEach(key => {
    if (!(key in acc)) acc[key] = [cur]
    else acc[key].push(cur)
  })
  return acc
}, {})
```

Reduce is immensely powerful. Use it where you can!
