Losing weight without muscle is my gain for the next few months. There are a few things that I've found out there that seem to be common, things that appear to be 'the way'. I'll stuff them here, partly to help me process, partly because I want to write some code.

There's some acronyms to get through, of course.

* BMR: Basal Metabolic Rate. This is, if you were in a coma, the amount of calories needed to keep you alive. If you eat this, you will likely lose weight
* TDEE: Total Daily Energy Expenditure. The total amount of calories to keep you going, at your current weight, with all of the activities you do. If you eat this, nothing will change. If you eat less, you will lose weight.

As well as this, there are some other things to keep in mind. From what I've seen on the internet, which never lies, there are two more things to keep in mind and this is specific to weight loss with muscle retention. Thou shalt:
* Eat 2.0-2.4g of protein for each KG of muscle mass.
* Aim to lose 0.5-1.0KG per week.

Of course, you still want to hit the gym and keep training - remind your body that you need those muscles. That training also burns extra calories, so we need to keep that in mind. For all of this, I've hacked out a calculator that we can use, below.
