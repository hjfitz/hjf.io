I’m [hjf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hjfitz/). This is a blog that I run on Netlify pages with Gatsby and Tailwind. I want it to use Preact, too. It’s mostly a learning project - but mostly because I wanted another project.

I’m in love with writing code, even though it's not officially part of my main job. I write a lot of JavaScript, TypeScript and go. My favourite pieces of tech are (P)React, Taliwind and serverless hosting.

Recently, I’ve built:

- [A basic p2p video/screen sharing chat, like Zoom](https://phone.hjf.io)
- [A Spotify app that lets you see your top tracks](https://spotify.hjf.io)
- [A fully featured custom text editor](https://github.com/hjfitz/rich-text-input)
- [A tiny event emitter](https://github.com/hjfitz/mitr)
- [A Spotify player for the CLI](https://github.com/hjfitz/spoticli)
- [An alternative to optional object chaining](https://github.com/hjfitz/hitcher)
- [A way to manipulate images in the DOM](https://github.com/hjfitz/js-images)
- [one](https://github.com/hjfitz/relay.ts), [two](https://github.com/hjfitz/mtws) clones of Express

There’s a lot more - but peek through the source code yourself! I’m [hjfitz on GitHub](https://github.com/hjfitz?tab=repositories).
